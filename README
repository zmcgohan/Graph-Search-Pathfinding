:.:.: Path Finder :.:.:

This program represents a graph search method and bidirectional search method of finding a path from one point on a grid to another point.

The grid is set up (in code) as a multi-dimensional array with None values as empty spaces, 0s as movable area and 1s as objects.

Most of the time bidirectional search takes about half of the time as regular graph search, but sometimes it is a tiny bit slower.
